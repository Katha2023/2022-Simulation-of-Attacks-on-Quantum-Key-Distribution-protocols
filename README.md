# Simulation of Attacks on Quantum Key Distribution Protocols

This project investigates the security of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols, focusing on the simulation of attacks and their impact on secure communication. Key topics covered include:

1. **Introduction to Cryptography**: Basics of cryptographic methods.
2. **Symmetric & Asymmetric Cryptography**: Principles of traditional encryption schemes.
3. **Quantum Threats**: How quantum computers threaten current cryptography.
4. **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**: An overview of quantum protocols like BB84 and E91.
5. **Attacks on QKD**: Simulation of intercept-and-resend attacks.
6. **Bellâ€™s Inequality**: Discussing the EPR paradox and CHSH inequality in the context of quantum cryptography.

The project also explores real-world QKD applications, principles used, and vulnerability analysis against common attacks.
